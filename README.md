# leaflet-challenge
I based the starter code around an in-class assignment. I got help from an AskBCS tutor on getting the depth to show up on each marker. I also got help with my markers showing up as cirlces instead of the default blue pins. Finally, I got help to make the legend show up on the webpage.
